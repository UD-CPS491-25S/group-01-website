# Flyer Enterprises Scheduler
Welcome to the GitHub page for our capstone project.

## Team Introduction
Our team consists of Adam Tkach, Justin Butler, Philip Chagoyan, Zejian Chen. We are all senior computer science students
at the University of Dayton.

## Sponsor Information
Our sponsor for this project is Flyer Enterprises. It is the fourth largest student-run business in the nation. They are
notable in retail commerce and offer students real-world business experience. Here is the link to their website if you
want to learn more about them: https://www.flyerenterprises.org/

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to automate the process of creating work schedules. Currently, Flyer Enterprises manually
create their work schedules, which takes a lot of time and effort. It also incurs a financial cost for them. This project
will solve this problem and allow Flyer Enterprises to quickly generate work schedules.
